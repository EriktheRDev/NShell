# NShell

The NShell is - currently just a program that prints out some stuff, but I hope to develop it further as I'm learning C++.

## Why is it currently useless?

Sorry, as of this writing, I just started learning C++, meaning I still have to learn most of the stuff. But I will work on enhancing this program.

## Why do you release the code anyway?

That is to show you how I'm progressing.
